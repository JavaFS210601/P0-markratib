Control Flow Idea 1

START OF FIRST WHILE LOOP
Print hello message
Ask user to input account number
get user input
Check if Account exists

If it exists:
show user their balance

else; (it doesnt exist)
ask user if they want to create an account
Assign the user an account number
set balance to 0
END OF FIRST WHILE

START OF SECOND WHILE LOOP
Show the operations menu
ask the user for input (probably just use numbers for simplicity)
get user input

if they want to check their balance:
ask which account to view
print their balance
continue loop2

if they want to deposit money:
ask which account they want to deposit to
ask for the ammount
add it to their balance
continue loop2

if they want to withdraw money:
ask for which account they want to withdraw from (possibly print account balance)
ask for the amount
if balance < amount:
tell them they ahve insufficient funds
else: (amount <= balance)
balance = balance - amount
continue loop2

If they want to transfer money:
check if the user has atleast 2 accounts
ask which account is the target
ask which account is the destination
check if target account has a balance greather than 0
get input for the ammount they want to transfer
if target account balance < input:
tell user insufficient funds
else: (input <= target account balance)
target account blannce = target account balance - input
destination account balance = destination account balance + input
continue loop2

If they want to open a new account:
ask what type of account
create new account
continue loop2

if they want to close an account:
ask which account
if target accounts balance != 0:
tell the suer the accounts balance must be 0 to close
else: (accounts balance is 0)
close (remove?) the account
continue loop2

If they want to quit:
set a bool to false
end loop2
